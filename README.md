A starter repository for a "classic-themed" blog website using Eleventy.

Of course, a very opinionated one, and probably forever, a work in progress!

## Completely re-written v2

At the end of 2022, Gulp and its plugins seem to be gone, and Eleventy has been updated quite a lot.
It was time to clean-up this template/starter!

## Tools

- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
- [markdown-it-eleventy-img](https://github.com/solution-loisir/markdown-it-eleventy-img)
- [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/)

## Theme

- Nunjucks port - with (nearly) same CSS - based on liquid layouts from [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com/) by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo)
- Some WCAG contrast corrections

## Bug reports, feature requests... or even stars

This is an ongoing project - even if I don't modify it everyday - and every suggestions, contributions or even stars are most welcome!
